## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a standard Flutter architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Entry Point**: Single `main.dart` file bootstraps the app with MaterialApp configuration
- **Screen-Based Navigation**: Separate screen widgets for home, booking, quotes, admin dashboard, and legal pages
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for managing application state and user authentication
- **Service Layer**: Dedicated services for API communication and authentication logic
- **Model Layer**: Data models for bookings, quotes, and user management
- **Theme System**: Centralized theme configuration with MY JANTES branding (red #DC2626, Roboto fonts)

The app implements Material Design 3 principles with custom theming to match the brand identity. The responsive design adapts to mobile, tablet, and web viewport sizes.

### Backend Integration
The Flutter app integrates with a WordPress backend through REST API endpoints:

- **API Service**: HTTP client wrapper for WordPress REST API communication
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication for admin access
- **File Upload**: Image upload functionality for quote requests with photo attachments
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for caching user preferences and authentication tokens

### Platform-Specific Configurations

**Android Configuration**:
- Bundle identifier: `fr.myjantes.app`
- Configured for both APK distribution and Google Play Store app bundles
- Keystore signing setup for production releases

**iOS Configuration**: 
- Bundle identifier: `fr.myjantes.app`
- Configured for ad-hoc distribution through TestApp.io (avoiding Apple Developer account requirement)

**Web Configuration**:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) ready with manifest.json
- Optimized for deployment on Hostinger hosting
- SEO-friendly with proper meta tags and Open Graph configuration

### CI/CD Architecture
The project uses Codemagic for automated builds and deployment:

- **Multi-platform Builds**: Separate workflows for Android, iOS, and Web
- **Automated Signing**: Keystore management for Android releases
- **Artifact Distribution**: Automated upload to various distribution channels
- **Environment Management**: Separate configurations for development and production
